      <h2 id="whats-this">What’s this?</h2>

<p>OzLockCon is the first open community event on physical security in Australia.</p>

<p>The conference focus is on both analogue and digital physical security systems and is open to professionals and hobbyists alike.</p>

<p>The 2-day event will provide a community space to share expertise on tools and techniques to learn new skills and refine existing ones.</p>

<p>Included are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>talks</li>
  <li>workshops</li>
  <li>and a variety of competitions (with prizes!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our sessions will be open to all attendees, run by industry-leading instructors across a range of topics.</p>

<p>Our aim is to cover not only traditional physical security controls (such as locks and safes) but also access control systems (alarm systems and <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>). This will include both networked and <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> devices.</p>

<p>We hope that all those attending find the experience both informative, engaging, and importantly, fun.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-plan">What’s the plan?</h2>

<p>OzLockCon will be held on the 3rd–4th of June 2017 in Melbourne between 10AM to 6PM each day.</p>

<p>The venue, “The Comics Lounge” is located at 26 Errol St, North Melbourne VIC 3051. There’s a <a href="#venue-map">Google map at the bottom of the page</a>.</p>

<p>We will publish the schedule shortly after the Call for Papers &amp; Workshops closes.</p>

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p>Talks will be range from 30–60 minutes long on all things physical security.</p>

<p>We will have some of the best talent in the world attend and present both
time-honoured techniques as well as the latest research.</p>

<h3 id="workshops">Workshops</h3>

<p>Workshops are run by experts who will demonstrate attacks such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>impressioning</li>
  <li>picking</li>
  <li>safe manipulation</li>
  <li>bumping</li>
  <li>bypass techniques</li>
  <li><abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>/radio attacks</li>
  <li>and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>These provide an excellent opportunity to practice and refine your skills regardless of expertise.</p>

<p>Workshops will run anywhere between an hour to all-weekend long without fixed class sizes.</p>

<h3 id="demonstrations">Demonstrations</h3>

<p>Similar to workshops, but not hands on. These will demo advanced skills such as destructive entry techniques, safe repair, lock making, and more.</p>

<h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>

<p>Lock-picking and handcuff evasion competitions have become increasingly popular across infosec conferences in Australia. These have usually attracted a fairly small and relatively inexperienced crowd, with familiar faces showing up at most events.</p>

<p>At OzLockCon we aim to find out who the best lock-picker in Australia is by testing their skills and knowledge.</p>

<p>More details as to the format and types of competitions will be announced closer to the date.</p>

<h3 id="panel">Panel</h3>

<p>On the final day we will be running a panel consisting of industry leaders and various experts including law enforcement, information security professionals, industry representatives, and hobbyists.</p>

<p>Our panel will discuss a wide variety of topics topical to physical security and locksport as a hobby in Australia.</p>
