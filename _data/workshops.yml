    This all-day, drop-in facial recognition workshop will let you get creative with visual disguise as you try to trick cameras into thinking you're invisible and stop them from recognising you. Use face paint, reflective tape, masks, wigs, fake beards, and your best ideas to craft an effective disguise in both bright and dark conditions. You'll learn the basics of how facial detection and recognition systems work, and then it's up to you to do your best against the workshop recognition systems and the ones you carry in your own pockets.

    The most creative disguise developed during the day will win a pair of (Reflectacles Ghost glasses)[https://www.reflectacles.com/], capable of bouncing back both visible and infrared light to make you harder for a computer to spot in an image.

    Group two mechanical safe locks have been the industry standard for sixty years. They're beautiful pieces of engineering but they CAN be beaten, and with a bit of hard work and practice, you can learn how. This workshop will teach you the absolute basics.  After that...it's just you, your practice lock, and hours spent alone in the spare room with your significant other wondering where the hell you've gone...

    Using a bag of tricks and a bit of grey matter participants will be challenged to decode keys from photos that will work a series of locks (photos will be of keys held by various staff). Stage 1 will consist of decoding 8 different keys that work two different 'areas' (A and B respectively). Stage 2 will then require participants to use the key codes to find the common patterns.
