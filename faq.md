## Who are you?

OzSecCon is a security conference unlike any other. We demonstrate and showcase research, tools and techniques from industry leading presenters around the world with the primary focus being physical security and access control. As this industry progresses, an overlap between traditional access control methods such as locks and keys are now becoming more digitally integrated. OzSecCon aims to bridge the divide between these two industries and educate and inspire everyone interested in the security industry. This event strives to bring together the best minds in the physical and digital security industries whilst still catering to those who are relatively new.

OzSecCon was born from a loose-knit group of physical security enthusiasts. We come from a diverse range of backgrounds; some of us work in security (eg. as locksmiths or in IT security), and many of us are locksport hobbyists — but what binds us all is our common interest and passion for all things security.
In early 2016 we started a chat channel as a place for us to share knowledge about physical security. For the most part we grew from 'hacker-conferences' and as such we have embraced the hacker spirit of sharing information: teaching each other and learning together.

We hope that one day the Australasian physical security community can be regarded as highly as the overseas communities are.

OzSecCon is organised by the following people:

## Who should attend?

* Physical Security Professionals
(Security System Integrators, Locksmiths, Law Enforcement, Forensic specialists, Risk/Policy managers)

* Digital Security Professionals

* Anyone involved in designing or implementing physical security solutions for clients or businesses

* Security Companies
(Hardware and Software integrators and developers).


If your company is involved with testing, integrating or developing security hardware or software, attending OzSecCon will demonstrate what types of common mistakes are made and how you and your company can avoid making the same mistakes or find similar issues. OzSecCon is also happy to have vendors demonstrate the latest technologies at the conference. If you would like to do that, [please get in touch with us via email.](mailto:{{ site.email }})

## Is this legal?

Yes. In our opinion, this conference is no different to information security/‘hacker’ conferences which is where this community stems from.

## Is possession of lockpicking tools legal?

See [*Review of Maximum Penalties for Preparatory Offences Report*](https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Review%20of%20Maximum%20Penalties%20for%20Preparatory%20Offences%20Report.pdf) (<small>§3.5 & §3.6</small>).

The summary of this is --- according to our interpretation --- that possession of lock picking equipment is legal as long as a reasonable explanation can be demonstrated. We are however, not lawyers. If this is of particular concern to you, it would be our recommendation that you consult a lawyer for legal advice.

## How do I fly with locksport equipment?

Many of us do this regularly as part of our work and hobby.

We recommend you place all tools *and locks* into your checked-in luggage. Why locks too? Most airport screeners will consider a 45mm padlock a potential weapon.

Hard moulded plastic cases are ideal and can often also be locked. Regular bags and suitcases are fine too provided that sensitive tools (eg. picks) are secure from being squashed to avoid gross frustration upon arrival.

## Aren't you teaching wannabe criminals?

We hope not. Anyone found to have criminal intent attending the conference will be summarily booted *and* reported to the authorities.

Additionally, we're going to borrow a quote as an answer:

> Rogues knew a good deal about lock-picking long before locksmiths discussed it [...] If a lock is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be, surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact, because the dishonest are [...] certain to apply the knowledge practically [...] the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.
