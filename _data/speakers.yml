  title: The Forensics of Lockpicking
  abstract: >
    This talk discusses Forensic Locksmithing - the art of identifying microscopic evidence of various non-destructive, covert entry techniques: lockpicking, impressioning, bumping, and more! While you may not be able to see it from the outside, almost all entry methods leave evidence inside locks that can be identified! Time permitting, we'll also cover inspection of keys, tools, and various "anti-forensics" tools.

  title: 8 ways to get past a door
  abstract: >
    An important part of physical security red teaming is gaining access to restricted areas. Most commonly, organisations control access using the humble door, with some sort of mechanism to prevent it from being opened by unauthorised parties. This talk will cover eight non-destructive entry techniques, from incredibly simple to rather complex, that have got the presenter past an access control door, and some ways these vulnerabilities could be mitigated

    Matt Smith's history in security goes back longer than he cares to remember. Starting with socially engineering access to sporting events and music festivals (The Ashes, World Cup, Glastonbury) he then got into physec from circumventing the locks on (and subsequently emptying) vending machines. After realising that there might be a legitimate future in it, he went on to work as a locksmith for several years before settling into his current role as a locktool and lock designer. Specialising in disc detainer locks, he cut his teeth by breaking Abloy Classic (after 107 years!), going onto design and make tools for the whole of the Abloy family, as well as the Silver Bullet (universal disc detainer tool). He also has designed many other tools for magnetic locks, lever locks, dimple locks, slider locks and is currently working on a universal pin tumbler decoding system.
    Also, Bsc (hons) Computer Science.

  title: Self Impressioning; the Locks That Pick Themselves
  abstract: >
    "Can you imagine being able to pick a lock in seconds with your eyes closed? Can you imagine doing it in a manner so easy that a small child could do it just as well as you? Now imagine doing this to the most secure locks on the planet! Locks like Evva 3KS, Abloy Protec II or Bilock?
    Compared to picking, conventional impressioning is a rarely used method for NDE of locks. This is because it takes a lot of skill and time to master, as well as access to the requisite key blanks.
    Self impressioning is impressioning with the skill and time removed. This talk will go through the theory of self impressioning as well as its practical application.
    As with most techniques, they are only as good as the tools and self impressioning tools are often the most intricate, beautiful works of art ever seen in the locksmithing world. We will study some of these tools, such as the Turbo Decoder (for auto locks), Magic Keys (for lever locks), the tubular lock tool (that we all own) as well as some others that I promise will be a very nice surprise!

      ANP Catalog: The Adversarial Ninja Playset. How To Bring Your Red Teaming Arsenal To Next Level.
  abstract: >
      During the last few years, Red Teaming engagements got more and more popular. This trend has pushed some hackers to R&D and release new opensource devices with the intent to make PhySec operations even more interesting. Smoothing the path to new TTPs and improving some old ones. During this talk will be presented five hacking devices developed from Offensive Ninjas, for Offensive Ninjas:
          * WHID Injector (a wifi-enabled Rubberducky on steroids and its mobile app, that allows to remotely inject keystrokes and bypass air-gapped environments).
          * P4wnP1 (a wifi-enabled BashBunny on steroids that allows a wide range of attacks, ranging from air-gap bypass to NET-NTLMv2 creds theft & crack a.k.a. Windows Lockpicker).
          * WHID Elite (a 2G-enabled offensive device that allows a threat actor to remotely inject keystrokes, bypass air-gapped systems, conduct mousejacking attacks, do acoustic surveillance, RF replay attacks and much more).
          * RFID-Tool (a wifi-enabled Wiegand bus implant that can sniff & replay data in order to steal & bypass RFID access control systems).
          * POTAEbox (a work-in-progress multi-purpose penetration dropbox that can be dropped over the "enemy lines" and  bypass .1x NAC, act rogue AP and stealthy pwn an entire corporate LAN).
        For each of these devices, we will go through their technical specifications and operational features. Passing, of course, through some real case scenarios where you can apply them during an Adversary Simulation. Nonetheless, will be presented also some tips for Blue-Teamers on how to detect and mitigate them.

      Elements of Lock Cylinder Design is an overview of the parts or elements that make a lock cylinder, and the comparison of how variations in the individual elements can increase or decrease the security of the lock.


      By analyzing the components in a cylinder, it is possible to develop a summary of the security rating of the lock. We will use illustrations and photographs of the cylinder to understand how various locks operate.

      We will use illustrations and photographs to see what the lock and keys look like, how they operate and estimatewhat security they provide.

    It's 2:00 AM. While on site for a red team engagement, you walk around a corner to find yourself face-to-face with a security officer. What should you do? What will they do? What do you actually know about this person? Based on over a decade working on the operational side of physical security, this talk looks at the people behind the uniform: who they are, how they operate, and what they do (and don't do). With a focus on red teaming and security consulting, we'll go through the key things to know about physical security teams, as well as some practical considerations for red team testing. Finally, we'll look at good security practices to help build security officer effectiveness.

  abstract: >
     This talk will cover 3 attack vectors on the HID access control system; Long Range RFID cloning, networked door controller exploitation and a replay attack.
      You will learn how the HID access control system works at a high level and how the RFID card traverses using the Wiegand protocol.
      Capturing, Cloning and Using the Long Range readers will be explained and demonstrated including a build guide.
      When Long range cloning fails and you have network access, this talk will cover how to exploit the networked door controller to open doors and add your own RFID credential to the database.
      When all else fails, using the ESP-RFID-TOOL device to replay credentials will be explained and demonstrated.

    Dial combination safe locks are the pinnacle of mechanical locking systems, and they certainly have a mystique all their own. The safe locks we use today are beautiful pieces of engineering and represent the latest product of an endless arms race between lock makers and safecrackers. But here's the thing: like all locks, with a little knowledge and a bit of skill they can be beaten.  This talk will show you how the Group 2 three wheel safelock works. You'll learn its weaknesses. And I'll give you the basic tools you'll need in order to be one of the few people on the planet that can beat them.
