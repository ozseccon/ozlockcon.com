## Announcement

We are pleased to announce we are back for a third (( 3 )) year running. We have decided to extend the con by one (( 1 )) whole day.  This means it is now three (( 3 )) whole days of madness.

Venue information will be out shortly.

## What's this?

OzSecCon is the first open community event on physical security in Australia.

The conference focus is on both analogue and digital physical security systems and is open to professionals and hobbyists alike.

The 3-day event will provide a community space to share expertise on tools and techniques to learn new skills and refine existing ones.

Included are:

- talks
- workshops
- and a variety of competitions (with prizes!)

Our sessions will be open to all attendees, run by industry-leading instructors across a range of topics.

Our aim is to cover not only traditional physical security controls (such as locks and safes) but also access control systems (alarm systems and <abbr title="Radio-frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>). This will include both networked and <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> devices.

We hope that all those attending find the experience both informative, engaging, and importantly, fun.
